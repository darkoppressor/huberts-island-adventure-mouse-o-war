# A line beginning with 'Android' tells the build system to build for Android
# The remainder of an Android line will be used to generate a new APP_ABI line in Application.mk
# The existing APP_ABI line in Application.mk will be replaced with the ABIs specified on the Android line

# Some Android targets don't work right now. They fail to compile, complaining of missing headers:
