The full Cheesy Build System Version 3 build script will mostly work

Exceptions:
Be sure that save_location.cfg is set to the default, as it differs from what the script understands
The normal.xcf icon image needs to be placed in development/images/icons/standard.xcf
The version needs to be updated everywhere
Also, the game code needs to handle the new version
