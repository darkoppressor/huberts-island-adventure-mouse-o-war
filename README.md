Hubert’s lovely picnic lunch has also been scattered across the Island, and it will be up to you to find the lost leaves and cheese. Work alone or with your friends in cooperative multiplayer mode! Can you recover the leaves and cheese, defeat Dakkar and his cronies, and save both Sally and the entire Island?
