To ensure you have the latest version of the game, see this link: http://cheeseandbacon.org/huberts-island/updates.php

For Windows, simply run the .exe file.

For OS X, simply run the application.

For Linux, do './Hubert', or './Hubert-Demo' for the demo version.
This will select the proper architecture and run the corresponding binary.
You might need to do 'chmod +x Hubert*' first, to make the launcher script and binary(s) executable.

Hopefully, just running the binary will get you going. If not, here are some tips
that might get the game working for you:

					Tips for getting the game running:

In the game folder, there should be a file called save_location.cfg.
It determines where all of the game's user data, such as save files and screenshots, are stored.
In Local mode, it saves everything in the game directory.
In Home mode, it saves everything somewhere user-editable (e.g., My Documents for Windows).
For ease of use, the game defaults to Home mode. However, Local mode is there if you would prefer to keep
everything contained.

In the user data folder, there should be a file called global_options.cfg.
If it isn't there, just run the game once to generate a new one.
The options stored in this file apply to the whole game, for all profiles.

There are a few other settings in global_options.cfg that you might want to look at.
Comments in the file should explain what each setting does.

						Tips for playing the game:

There are 3 different difficulty settings, helpfully named Easy, Normal, and Hard.
If the game is too hard, or too easy, you might consider changing the difficulty.
This setting sets the game's base difficulty. Difficulty can be modified by a couple things, and
actually be higher. The primary cause of increased difficulty is New Game Plus mode. When you beat the
game for the first time, it enters New Game Plus mode. Each time you beat the game, the New Game Plus level
increases by 1. The main menu will have a notification informing you of the current New Game Plus level.
Higher New Game Plus levels increase difficulty (+1 difficulty per level) and increase the amount of points
you get per piece of candy (+1 point per candy per level).

Normal is the base difficulty, and everything works normally.

Easy affects several things:
-Some baddies are removed from levels.
-Moving platforms slow down.
-Baddies slow down.
-Bosses have less health.
-Ammo Boxes and Barrels have more ammo in them.
-Baddies' shots move more slowly.

Similarly, levels of difficulty beyond Normal affect several things:
-Extra NPCs spawn in levels.
-Moving platforms speed up.
-Baddies speed up.
-Bosses have more health.
-Baddies' shots move more quickly.

If you need more ammo, pressing the 'b', 'a', and 't' keys together might help you out...

There is a day/night cycle in the game, which causes the world to grow darker as night
falls (according to your computer's clock). Light emanates from Hubert and other light
sources. By default, this is inactive. However, if you want it, you can enable it
separately for the world map and in levels. It is just for show.
If your game seems to get less responsive at night with this mode on, it may mean your
computer cannot handle the lighting system. You can either disable it, or try making
the lighting tiles larger in global_options.cfg.

There are 4 different playable characters in the game:
1. Hubert, being the eponymous hero of this game, is the default character.
He is essentially a balance between Slime-O and Sketch.

2. Slime-O is heavier and slower than Hubert. He can come to a stop more easily, jump
a little higher, and runs a little slower than Hubert. He is an excellent choice
if you are having a hard time controlling Hubert.

3. Sketch is the polar opposite of Slime-O. He is lighter and faster than Hubert.
He also cannot jump as high as Hubert. He is probably the hardest of the three
to control, but if you can master him, you can truly fly through some levels.

4. Penny is fast and agile. She is the quickest of the group, but she takes
some experience to control properly.

At any time, you can view a map of any level in the game. Simply go to the
Level Information screen, find the level you wish to see, and hit View Map.
Levels are mapped out as you play them, so if you have never been to a level before,
there won't be a map of it yet. There is also a handy "open map" key that will open
the map for the level you are currently in.

The Level Information screen also has a few stats that are specific to each level,
which you can view at any time.

The Inventory screen shows you what items you currently have.

The Stats screen shows a variety of stats that are recorded as you play.

The Achievements screen shows a variety of accomplishments, and whether you have
achieved them yet or not.

						Fun Facts:

You usually get candy for stunning baddies and beating levels, but every so often you will get ammo instead.

Undead NPCs are faster at night, and even faster at midnight.

Undead NPCs don't have reflections.

Difficulty is increased by 1 on Friday the 13th.

Candy items are worth 25% more points during a full moon.

Some holidays are supported in the game, causing the GUI to change, candy to have holiday-themed colors,
the game icon to change, and more!
